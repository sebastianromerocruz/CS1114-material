### Part 0: _Review_

Let's start with a quick review problem. Let's pretend we have two classroom sizes: one that fits 35 students and one 
that fits 15. Write a program that does the following:

1. Ask the user how large the student body is (i.e. how many students there are).
2. Determine how many 35-student classrooms we can form with this many students.
3. Determine how many 15-student classrooms we can form with the remaining students.
4. Display the results of steps 2 and 3, along with how many students remain leftover.
