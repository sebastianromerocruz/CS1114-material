### Part 1: _Character Stats_

Hey, my name is Sebasti√°n, and my last names are Romero Cruz. I teach about programming for a living and, incredibly, 
sometimes even enjoy programming itself.

I have been teaching at the Tandon since January 2020, making this my fifth semester as an instructor. I also happen to
have gotten my bachelor of science degree here, in chemical and biomolecular engineering, and my master's in computer 
science. So, you know, I've been here a while.

Here's how you can reach me if you have any questions:

| **Email**                              | **Office Hours**                                                      |

Unless you have a super trivial question, **I much prefer you scheduling office hours with me to ask me questions about
the course**. Even if we only spend 5 minutes on a Zoom call, it is a lot easier for me to keep track of my calendar 
this way, and a lot harder for me to lose track of your e-mail (something I am unfortunately wont to do).

Anyway, other things I enjoy are:

- **Slice of life anime**: my favourite is [***Hibike! Euphonium***](https://youtu.be/Cb9OAuquKaI)
- **French history**: anything starting with the French Revolution of 1789 to the end of the de Gaulle presidency in 1969. 
- **Literature**: my current favourite is [***Paris is a Party, Paris is a Ghost***](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374722494).
- **Playing music**: I play a [**Rickenbacker 4001C64**](http://www.rickenbacker.com/model.asp?model=4001C64).

That's all I want to flex at the present moment. We basically spent the rest of the class talking about the syllabus, so
please refer to it in the [**Brightspace page**](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/174168).

Course assistant office hours (your first source for help) will be announced next week. You can also join our 
[**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/5tZ6HAjHMY) for lighter support!
